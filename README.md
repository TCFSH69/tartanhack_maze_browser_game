# Scream Maze

## Inspiration

Modern life is stressful. We believe people need better ways to release tension and decompress. Inspired by the classic arcade game Pac-Man and incorporating mosaic-style visual elements, we set out to build a stress-relief experience that is both nostalgic and refreshing. Instead of tapping buttons quietly, we wanted players to physically let it all out — by screaming.

## What It Does

Scream Maze is a browser-based horror maze game where your voice is your weapon. Players navigate through a dark, procedurally generated maze while being chased by ghosts. The microphone picks up your voice — the louder you scream, the more you fight back. It turns fear and stress into a fun, cathartic release.
